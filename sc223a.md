# `Smartsens` Image Sensor `sc223a` in [OpenIPC](https://github.com/OpenIPC)

- [install sc223a driver](https://github.com/OpenIPC/wiki/blob/master/en/firmware-sensor-install-sc223a.md) <!-- [get 41.25 fps from sc223a](https://github.com/OpenIPC/firmware/issues/1324) and after that even  --> 
- [get 42-45 fps from sc223a](#set-sensor-clock-on-goke-boards-example)

## Is it really a sc223a?
- There are [3 sensors with same chip id](https://github.com/OpenIPC/ipctool/issues/112) `cb3e` all seen as `sc223a` by OpenIPC.
  - `sc223a`
    - [30 fps](https://smartsens.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/web/products/SC223A_V3.0.pdf)
  - `sc233a`
    - [60 fps](https://smartsens.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/web/products/SC233A_V3.0.pdf)
  - `sc2239p`
    - ?
  - Sensors sold as `sc5239s` also have Chip ID `cb3e`.
    - work with [sc223a driver](https://github.com/OpenIPC/wiki/blob/master/en/firmware-sensor-install-sc223a.md)
    - can stream [41.25 fps](https://github.com/OpenIPC/firmware/issues/1324) and [42-45 fps](#set-sensor-clock-on-goke-boards-example)
    - My tests are done with it. I am still not sure which sensor this really is.
- So when I say `sc223a` it means one of the 3 chips with that ID.

## Sensor Clock test on goke soc (gk7205v210)
- fps values may vary depending on your `luminance` and `exposure` image settings.

### [Set sensor clock](https://github.com/OpenIPC/wiki/blob/master/en/install-goke.md#a-trick-for-gk7205v300imx335-users) on goke boards example
```bash
# sc223a: get 42-45 fps 
devmem 0x120100f0 32 0x09
```
